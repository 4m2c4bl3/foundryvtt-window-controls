# Window Controls for Foundry VTT

Minimize (Enhanced!), Maximize and Pin floating Windows. Configurable.

Organized Minimized mode allows minimizing windows on a fixed horizontal taskbar on top or bottom.

This was formerly part of **Minimal UI**, but it was ripped off for better flexibility and independence.

**Recommended with Minimal UI**

## 4 Available Settings
### Minimize button (Default: On)
Adds a minimize button that does the same as double-clicking the header

### Organized Minimize (Default: Top with Bar)
Allows minimizing windows into a horizontal taskbar. Possible options are:
* **Top with Bar (Default)**: Minimize all windows inside a semi transparent bar that appears and resizes as necessary
* **Top**: Minimizes all windows on an invisible horizontal taskbar at the top of the screen below scenes
* **Bottom with Bar**: Minimize all windows inside a semi transparent bar at the bottom of the screen
* **Bottom**: Minimizes all windows on an invisible horizontal taskbar located at the bottom of the screen
* **Disabled**: Default behavior in Foundry. Minimizes wherever the window was originally.

### Pinned Button (Default: Off)
Adds a pin button on window controls, to prevent a window from being closed.
One point behind this, is when having multiple windows opened. Pressing `ESC` will close ALL of them.
Pinned windows, however, will not be closed on these circumstances or in any other circumstances, until unpinned with the same button.
This is useful for character sheets or very important actors that we never want to close, and find them quickly.

### Maximize Button (Default: Off)
Adds a maximize button that will expand resizable windows to the maximum available size. Can be restored with the same button.
